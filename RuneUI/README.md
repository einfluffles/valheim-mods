# Rune UI

A new look for Valheim's HUD. Your health, stamina, hotbars and food sit together at the bottom
centre of the screen, drawn in one theme whose colours, font and shape you can change. Rune UI also
adds a second quick bar and a list of the players around you.

This is the first part of a full UI redesign. The inventory, crafting, build and menu screens will be
restyled in later versions.

## What it does

- **Bars at the bottom centre.** Health, stamina, eitr, adrenaline and stagger are drawn as shaded,
  themed bars. Eitr shares the stamina row once you have any. Adrenaline and stagger are thin bars
  above health that only show while they fill, so health and stamina never move.
- **Hotbar under the bars.** The hotbar moves to the bottom centre and its slots get the theme. Your
  forsaken power sits as a ninth slot on its right, with its key and cooldown. The bars, hotbar and
  quick bar sit together on a dark panel in a bronze frame with gems in its corners.
- **Second quick bar.** Your second inventory row is shown as another hotbar under the first, with
  Alt shown once on its left. Hold Left Alt and press 1 to 8 to use its items. While Alt is held, 1
  to 8 do not use the normal hotbar.
- **Quick slots.** Up to six extra slots for any item but ammo, shown right of the quick bar and below
  your inventory, or right of it while a chest is open. Each has its own key, Z, V and B for the
  first three, and you can change the keys and labels. A key uses its item: eats food, drinks a mead,
  or equips a weapon or tool. While you use one, vanilla actions on the same key, such as V for auto
  pickup, do not trigger. Items in them count toward your weight, and workbenches repair and upgrade
  them there. They are not used as crafting or building material.
- **Gear slots.** Six slots for worn armour right of the inventory: head, chest, legs, cape, utility and
  trinket, in a row or laid out over a body outline. An empty slot shows a faint icon of what goes
  there. What is in them is worn, so armour no
  longer takes up inventory space.
  Put armour on in any way and it moves into its slot; drag it out or right click it and it comes off.
  Workbenches repair and upgrade it in the slots, and it counts toward your weight. While you hold an
  item, the quick and gear slots it fits in light up. Hold Left Alt and drag either row to move it.
- **Balance options.** Off by default: wear up to three utility items at once, add inventory rows, and
  change the base carry weight.
- **Back in place after death.** Quick and gear slots go into your tombstone with everything else.
  When you pick your things up again, items go back into their quick slot and everything you wore is
  put on again, as long as you have not put something else in that place meanwhile. Settings let you
  keep the gear or quick slots on death instead, or skip re-equipping.
- **Buffs in one place.** Eaten food and status effects such as Rested or Wet are shown together as
  hotbar sized icons in the bottom left, filling rows upwards. Rested and Resting show your comfort
  level in the corner. Like vanilla, a food icon pulses when
  you can eat it again and the timer blinks in the last minute.
- **Quality rings.** Upgradable items get a ring in their quality colour in the hotbars, inventory and
  chests: grey, green, blue and gold for quality 1 to 4, and red with the number for items upgraded
  past their normal maximum.
- **Skill toasts.** When a skill gains experience, a toast on the right shows its level and a bar
  with the progress to the next level. Further gains of that skill update the same toast and keep it
  up; a level up flashes the name.
- **Key hints in a column.** The key hints in the bottom right are stacked instead of running in a
  long row into the quick slots.
- **Party list.** Players within 100 metres are listed in the top left with their health bar and
  numbers, closest first. The health bars floating over their heads are hidden; their names stay.
- **Your theme.** Panel, border, text and bar colours, the font, corner roundness and border width
  are all settings, and every block can be moved and scaled.

Everything can be switched off individually, and turning the mod off puts the vanilla HUD back.

## Installing

With a mod manager, just install it. Manually, drop `RuneUI.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins`.

Client side only. It changes nothing that other players or the server can see, so it works on any
server and nobody else needs it. The party list reads the health every client already receives.

The quick and gear slots are saved inside your character file. If you remove the mod, the items in them
stay in the save and are back when you install it again, so empty the slots first if you want to keep
those items without the mod.

## Coming from Equipment and Quick Slots

Rune UI's quick and gear slots replace Equipment and Quick Slots, so remove that mod. The first time
you log in with Rune UI, the items in its quick and equipment slots move into Rune UI's slots, and
anything else from its extra rows into free inventory cells. Anything that does not fit is dropped by
the game where you spawn, so make some room in your inventory before switching.

If you already played without either mod and the game dropped your slot items, the cheat command
`runeui_eaqs_restore` brings back the items in Equipment and Quick Slots' last backup. Only use it if
the items are really gone, since it creates them again.

## Other mods

- **Better Archery** (2.x) works alongside. It keeps its quiver in two rows below your inventory and
  shows the quiver itself; Rune UI never puts items into those rows and keeps them when it adds
  inventory rows.
- **Equipment and Quick Slots** is replaced by Rune UI; see above.
- **Epic Loot** sees gear and items worn from the quick and gear slots, so their magic effects and
  set bonuses count.

## Console commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `runeui_slots` | Lists what is in the quick and gear slots |
| `runeui_emptyslots` | Takes off and moves everything in the quick and gear slots into the inventory, for example before removing the mod |
| `runeui_eaqs_restore` | Cheat. Brings back the items in Equipment and Quick Slots' backup, see above |

## Settings

Config file: `BepInEx/config/ithilias.runeui.cfg`, created the first time you run the game. Settings
apply immediately, without a restart.

Anchors are one of `TopLeft`, `Top`, `TopRight`, `Left`, `Center`, `Right`, `BottomLeft`, `Bottom`
and `BottomRight`. A block's matching corner or edge sits on that point of the screen, moved by its
offsets. Offsets go from -2000 to 2000; negative values move left and down.
